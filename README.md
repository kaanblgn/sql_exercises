English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director.

Reviewer ( rID, name )
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name.

Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate )

Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. [View the database] (https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YDB-SQL0001+2T2020+type@asset+block/moviedata.html)
